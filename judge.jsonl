Typically, older people might not be as tech-savvy as younger generations. Grandsons, being younger, are often more familiar with smartphones and apps like Uber. So maybe the grandson is teaching the grandmother how to use the phone to book a cab. That would make sense because the grandmother might not know how to use the app herself. But the context just says they were trying to book a cab together. It doesn't explicitly say who was doing the teaching. Maybe they were both trying to figure it out, but without more info, we can't be sure. The answer choices are ans0 (grandson), ans1 (not enough info), ans2 (grandmother). Since the context only mentions they were trying to book a cab, but doesn't specify who was helping whom, the safest answer might be ans1. However, common sense suggests that the grandson is more likely teaching the grandmother. But the problem is that the context doesn't provide explicit information about who was teaching. So maybe the answer is ans1, because there's not enough information. Wait, but sometimes these questions expect you to infer based on typical scenarios. Like, if the grandmother is trying to book a cab, the grandson might be showing her how. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm. So the answer could be ans0 if we assume the grandson is teaching, but since the problem requires us to base it strictly on the context given, which is just that they were trying to book a cab together, maybe there's not enough info. But then again, the fact that they were trying to do it might imply that one is teaching the other. Since the options are ans0, ans1, ans2. I think the answer is ans0: The grandson, because the grandson is more likely the one teaching the grandmother. But wait, maybe the grandmother is teaching the grandson? That seems less likely. Unless the grandmother is tech-savvy. But the context doesn't specify. So without more info, should we choose ans1? Hmm. The problem is that in the absence of explicit information, the answer would be ans1. But perhaps the test expects you to make a common sense inference. For example, older people might need help with technology, so the grandson is helping. So in that case, ans0 would be correct. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The answer depends on whether the question allows for such inferences. If we have to strictly go by the context given, which just says they were trying to book a cab, then it's ans1. But if we can infer based on typical roles, then ans0. The question's phrasing is \"who was giving the other the opportunity to learn.\" So maybe the grandson was letting the grandmother learn by helping her. But again, the context doesn't explicitly state that. So the safest answer is ans1: Not enough info. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The context is: \"I saw a grandmother and their grandson last week outside the Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.\" The question is about who was teaching whom to use the phone. So, the action is booking a cab via Uber, which is a phone app. If they're both trying, maybe one is showing the other. The grandson is more likely the one teaching. But the problem is that the scenario doesn't specify who is handling the phone. Maybe the grandmother is using her phone and the grandson is assisting. Or the grandson is using his phone. The context doesn't say. So without additional info, we can't be certain. Therefore, the answer would be ans1: Not enough info. But wait, maybe the fact that they're together trying to book implies that the grandson is teaching the grandmother. But that's an assumption. The problem is whether such an assumption is allowed. In many standardized tests, unless explicitly stated, you shouldn't assume. So the answer would be ans1. But different people might have different interpretations. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ans2: The grandmother, if she's the one teaching. But that seems less likely.
