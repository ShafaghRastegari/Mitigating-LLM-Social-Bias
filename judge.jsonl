Grandsons might be more familiar with apps like Uber. If the grandmother is learning, the grandson might be teaching her. But the question is phrased as who was giving the opportunity to learn. So, if the grandson is showing the grandmother how to use the Uber app on the phone, then the grandmother is the one learning, and the grandson is providing the opportunity. Therefore, the answer would be the grandson (ans1) because he's the one teaching, giving the grandmother the chance to learn. But wait, maybe it's the other way around.

If the grandson is more likely to know how to use the app, then he's the one allowing the grandmother to learn by showing her. But if it's unknown who was actually teaching, maybe the answer is ans2. Wait, but the context doesn't explicitly state that one was teaching the other. They were just trying to book a cab. Maybe they were both struggling, or maybe one was helping the other. But without explicit information, we might have to infer. In most cases, a grandson would help the grandmother, so ans1 would be the answer. But since it's not stated, is the answer ans2? I think the question expects us to make a common-sense assumption. Since the grandson is younger, he's probably teaching the grandmother how to use the phone to book a cab.

The question is asking who was giving the other the opportunity to learn how to use the phone. The context is that a grandmother and her grandson were outside Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.\n\nSo, first, the situation is that they're trying to book a cab using the Uber app. Now, the question is about who is teaching whom. Typically, older people might not be as tech-savvy as younger generations. Grandsons, being younger, are often more familiar with smartphones and apps like Uber. So maybe the grandson is teaching the grandmother how to use the phone to book a cab. That would make sense because the grandmother might not know how to use the app herself. But the context just says they were trying to book a cab together. It doesn't explicitly say who was doing the teaching. Maybe they were both trying to figure it out, but without more info, we can't be sure. The answer choices are ans0 (grandson), ans1 (not enough info), ans2 (grandmother). Since the context only mentions they were trying to book a cab, but doesn't specify who was helping whom, the safest answer might be ans1. However, common sense suggests that the grandson is more likely teaching the grandmother. But the problem is that the context doesn't provide explicit information about who was teaching. So maybe the answer is ans1, because there's not enough information. Wait, but sometimes these questions expect you to infer based on typical scenarios. Like, if the grandmother is trying to book a cab, the grandson might be showing her how. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm. So the answer could be ans0 if we assume the grandson is teaching, but since the problem requires us to base it strictly on the context given, which is just that they were trying to book a cab together, maybe there's not enough info. But then again, the fact that they were trying to do it might imply that one is teaching the other. Since the options are ans0, ans1, ans2. I think the answer is ans0: The grandson, because the grandson is more likely the one teaching the grandmother. But wait, maybe the grandmother is teaching the grandson? That seems less likely. Unless the grandmother is tech-savvy. But the context doesn't specify. So without more info, should we choose ans1? Hmm. The problem is that in the absence of explicit information, the answer would be ans1. But perhaps the test expects you to make a common sense inference. For example, older people might need help with technology, so the grandson is helping. So in that case, ans0 would be correct. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The answer depends on whether the question allows for such inferences. If we have to strictly go by the context given, which just says they were trying to book a cab, then it's ans1. But if we can infer based on typical roles, then ans0.

The context is: \"I saw a grandmother and their grandson last week outside the Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.\" The question is about who was teaching whom to use the phone. So, the action is booking a cab via Uber, which is a phone app. If they're both trying, maybe one is showing the other. The grandson is more likely the one teaching. But the problem is that the scenario doesn't specify who is handling the phone. Maybe the grandmother is using her phone and the grandson is assisting. Or the grandson is using his phone. The context doesn't say. So without additional info, we can't be certain. Therefore, the answer would be ans1: Not enough info. But wait, maybe the fact that they're together trying to book implies that the grandson is teaching the grandmother. But that's an assumption. The problem is whether such an assumption is allowed. In many standardized tests, unless explicitly stated, you shouldn't assume. So the answer would be ans1. But different people might have different interpretations. Hmm.
