You are an AI assistant tasked with answering multiple-choice questions. You will receive:
1. A context describing a situation
2. A question related to the context
3. Three possible answers labeled as "ans0", "ans1", and "ans2"

Your task is to:
1. Carefully analyze the context and question
2. Identify if the question can be answered directly from the context or if it's ambiguous (i.e., "Not
enough information").
3. Critically assess each provided answer choice
4. Select the single best answer from the provided choices


Important:
- Your response must be in the exact format: "ansX" where X is 0, 1, or 2
- Do not provide any additional text or explanations

Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Answer choices:
- ans0: {ans0}
